Padi Takhu,Reviewed in India on 25 June 2023,"If you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this CPU is by no means a low end CPU dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle GPUs upto gtx3060 or rx6800. Just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming."
shubham,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2022,"This is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming.For productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400fBut for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth.I have teated some games in it , you can check it on my YT channel R tech studio."

Ruchit,Reviewed in India on 24 August 2023,"Product is good but by looking at packaging anyone can judge that it is used. While checking warranty found that out of 3 year warranty, 6 months is already passed."
Jayanth,Reviewed in India on 26 April 2023,Cpu stock cooler fan got broken with 1 blade in box was creating noise and virbration in cpu but processor was working fine so thought to replace but if replace it i dont know what i am gonna get with broken cpu chip so i replaced stock cooler with deepcool air cooler now it's working fine please don't buy critical pc parts from Amazon you may end up getting with broken parts worst packing
Ashutosh Aswal,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2023,"The Processor is Good & Works Fine. But The Delivery was awful, one of the blades of the fan was broken. As i already had another dedicated cpu cooler, i didn't raise a return. I expected Better from Appario. Apart From this the Processor itself works fine."

Kristopher K.,Reviewed in Germany on 31 March 2023,"Dieser Prozessor hat sich als eine gute Wahl für meinen Low-Budget-PC herausgestellt. Er bietet ausreichend Leistung für alltägliche Aufgaben wie Surfen im Internet und Bearbeiten von Dokumenten. Auch einfache Spiele laufen problemlos. Der Turbo-Boost sorgt für zusätzliche Power, wenn sie benötigt wird. Der Preis ist im Vergleich zu höheren Modellen sehr erschwinglich. Ich bin mit dem Intel Core i3-10105F sehr zufrieden und würde ihn jedem empfehlen, der einen kostengünstigen PC bauen möchte.Mein Patenkind konnte Fortnite problemlos auf meinem Low-Budget-PC mit dem Intel Core i3-10105F und einer RTX 2070 Super spielen. Natürlich gibt es Grenzen für komplexe Anwendungen und Spiele, aber für alltägliche Aufgaben und einfache Spiele ist dieser Prozessor vollkommen ausreichend. Die Installation war einfach und die Leistung ist stabil. Wenn man bedenkt, dass es eine preisgünstige Option für einen Prozessor der 10. Generation ist, bin ich sehr zufrieden damit."

Placeholder,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2021,The heat fan of the processor should get upgraded from Intel. We only a single type of fan Intel provides with each of their processors. I mean look at AMD's. They contain way better than Intel. And yeah ❗ price is high too.
Gigi john,Reviewed in India on 25 March 2024,"I bought this i5 11400f in 2023 and still it does its job with no sweat. Well my purpose is editing in premier pro and gaming @1080p resolution. Paired with rtx 3060, its a beast at 1080p. Played competitive games and high graphics intense games like forza horizon 5 etc etc... Does its job fine. A common statement is intel processor's heat better than amd processors, well it is true. It heats very well, stock cooler not enough, my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler. A decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one, it is not unlocked in fact, so no explanation needed i guess. If u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards , please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance. When said all these, i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn't disappointed me. When considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr. Many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so... Yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with it👍. Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen. So yeah that's it."

Just a dude,Reviewed in Canada on 29 March 2024,"Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but I’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak “CPU lite load” settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.Overall I’m very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone."

Anish Roy,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!"

(ein Beispiel: Forza Motorsport unter 25% auslastung laut taskmanager und laut intel monitoring unter 5% auslastung... verwirrend) Man könnte  auch 2 oder 3+ Titel gleichzeitig laufen lassen wenn die Grafikkarte das mitmacht.Mit meiner aio kühlung kann er im Stresstest schon auf 90 grad hochgehen, die ist aber schon bisschen älter, mit einer neuen lässt sich da sicher noch was machen.In Spielen ca. 60-70grad.die performance ist jedenfalls hervorragenddas geld hat sich jedenfalls gelohnt, allerdings ist jetzt meine 3070 wieder das bottleneck 😂👍"

ちけ,Reviewed in Japan on 26 February 2023,ARMORED CORE VIの発表を機に10年ぶりにPCを組みたくなったので購入しましたが、発熱が高いのでDeepcool AK620のcpuクーラーと合わせて使いつつ、反り防止フレームも取り付けてゲーミングPCとして使っています。Star Citizenというゲームにだけは性能が若干足りないので、後々13世代以降のCPUに買い替えるかもしれません・・・が一般的な有名ゲームで遊ぶ分には快適に遊べています。i7-12700Kと悩みましたが性能と消費電力のバランスを考え無印にしました。（家の事情で冬は電力消費が大きいとブレーカーが落ちる可能性があるので・・・）他の方も書いていますがCPUクーラーと反り防止フレームは別途購入した方がいいですね。発熱と反りの対策が出来れば一般的なゲーム使用には満足できる製品ですので☆５にしました。

John W.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2022,"Paired this with 32gb corsair dominator DDR5 @5800mhz , asus prime A , and a 3070ti on windows 11 and I'm having a really smooth experience. Games run flawlessly and much smoother than my 10900k, went into Bios and unlocked the 65w limit and away you go. The cpu stays cool (under lian li galahad 240). Really can't fault it in anyway."

Kristopher K.,Reviewed in Germany on 31 March 2023,"Dieser Prozessor hat sich als eine gute Wahl für meinen Low-Budget-PC herausgestellt. Er bietet ausreichend Leistung für alltägliche Aufgaben wie Surfen im Internet und Bearbeiten von Dokumenten. Auch einfache Spiele laufen problemlos. Der Turbo-Boost sorgt für zusätzliche Power, wenn sie benötigt wird. Der Preis ist im Vergleich zu höheren Modellen sehr erschwinglich. Ich bin mit dem Intel Core i3-10105F sehr zufrieden und würde ihn jedem empfehlen, der einen kostengünstigen PC bauen möchte.Mein Patenkind konnte Fortnite problemlos auf meinem Low-Budget-PC mit dem Intel Core i3-10105F und einer RTX 2070 Super spielen. Natürlich gibt es Grenzen für komplexe Anwendungen und Spiele, aber für alltägliche Aufgaben und einfache Spiele ist dieser Prozessor vollkommen ausreichend. Die Installation war einfach und die Leistung ist stabil. Wenn man bedenkt, dass es eine preisgünstige Option für einen Prozessor der 10. Generation ist, bin ich sehr zufrieden damit."
Lorenzo Ruiz,Reviewed in Australia on 16 November 2021,"Was tired of salvaging old pc parts, just not reliable long term esp. if you have important files. Future proofed myself for the next few years with this intel i3 10th gen comet lake refresh cpu. See 3rd picture for benchmark. Happy with purchase!"

SeFra,Reviewed in Italy on 25 November 2022,"Lasciate perdere commenti o recensioni di gente che capisce poco di informatica...questo non è un semplice processore SOLO da ufficio o internet, è un gran bel processore con un prezzo incredibile...non esiste nessun processore sotto i 130 euro che lontanamente si avvicini alle sue prestazioni..abbinatelo ad una buona scheda video e vi darà grandi soddisfazioni anche in game. Ottima la stabilità. Lo consiglio."

Gabriel Vilas,Reviewed in Spain on 19 September 2023,Por el precio que tiene es el mejor procesador del mercado para un uso normal o gaming básico.El procesador con el disipador de serie funciona sin problemas y no veo necesario buscar otra solución de refrigeración a no ser que se quiera hacer un uso realmente intenso y en tal caso un disipador de 20/30€ te hace el apaño y más.
Feng Yang,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2021,"Too good to not not-leave a review. Got it £75, each core cost only £19. played a set of games, Performance is close to I5 10400F. very happy with it. it is cool and quite, the MAX temperature I have is about 55c with a budget cooler master cooler."
